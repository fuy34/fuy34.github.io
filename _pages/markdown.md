## Leisure Time

Apart from being a Ph.D. student, I enjoy my time with movies, computer games, and travel. I also like to play badminton and billiards, regardless of my poor skill.

## My Hometown

I am from a small city called Wenzhou in China. I am very proud of my hometown and our dialect, Wenzhou Hua. Some people rank it as the world's most difficult dialect and call it  ["Devil's language"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVUkc5YUSs/). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-YX9LzVes/) is an interesting comparison between my hometown language and Cantonese. **Have fun!**
