I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at [Penn State](https://www.psu.edu/), working with [Dr. Sharon Huang](https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/suh972/) and [Dr. Zihan Zhou](https://zihan-z.github.io/). Befor joining Penn State, I worked with [Dr. Bin Wu](http://jyxy.tju.edu.cn/cn/szdw/20110224/309.shtml) and received my Master degree in Instrument Science and Technology and Bachelor degree in Measuring and Control Technology and Instrumentations from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/) in 2017 and 2014, respectively.

My research interest lies on **computer vision**, **deep learning** and **3D metrology**. Most of my recent works focus on integrating geometry priors into deep neural networks for **3D vision** tasks. Please refer to my [CV](https://fuy34.github.io/files/CV_github.pdf) for more details.
